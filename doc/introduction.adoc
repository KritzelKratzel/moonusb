== Introduction

MoonUSB is an almost one-to-one Lua binding library to  https://libusb.info/[libusb].
This means that by and large, it is intended to be used as described in the 
http://libusb.sourceforge.net/api-1.0/[libusb documentation].

MoonUSB binds libusb structs (contexts, devices, device handles, etc) to Lua userdata,
exposing an *object oriented* interface to the Lua programmer. Most libusb functions are
exposed by MoonUSB as methods of the relevant objects they act on.
For example, the _libusb_open(&nbsp;)_ and _libusb_close(&nbsp;)_ functions are exposed
as the _device:open(&nbsp;)_ and  _devhandle:close(&nbsp;)_ methods, respectively.

Lua object types in MoonUSB are listed in the tree below, together with the corresponding
structs in libusb, if any:

[small]#<<context, context>> _(libusb_context)_ +
{tH}<<hotplug, hotplug>> _(libusb_hotplug_callback_handle)_ +
{tH}<<device, device>> _(libusb_device)_ +
{tI}{tL}<<device, devhandle>> _(libusb_device_handle)_ +
{tI}{tS}{tH}<<device, interface>> _(libusb_device_handle + interface number)_ +
{tI}{tS}{tH}<<asynchapi, transfer>> _(libusb_transfer)_ +
{tI}{tS}{tL}<<hostmem, hostmem>> _(none)_ +
{tL}<<hostmem, hostmem>> _(none)_#

The <<hostmem, hostmem>> object is a MoonUSB-specific object that encapsulates a memory
area, to be (optionally) used as memory buffer in transfer functions. It is listed twice
because it may be either standalone, or tied to a <<device, devhandle>> (possibly 
encapsulating DMA memory for that specific device).

Objects are *garbage collected at exit* (which includes on error), and automatically
deleted at the libusb level with graceful release whenever possible, so there is no need to
explicitly invoke their deletion methods at exit for cleanup. 

Apart from at exit, however, objects are not automatically garbage collected 
footnote:[Objects are anchored to the Lua registry at their creation, so even if the script does not
have references to an object, a reference always exists on the registry and this prevents the 
GC to collect it.]
and one must release them explicitly when needed, e.g. to release resources when the
application is not exiting and some objects are no longer needed.

Releasing an object causes the automatic (pre) destruction of all its children
objects (as per the above tree), and the invalidation of any reference to the object and to
its children.footnote:[It is good practice to not leave invalid references to objects around, because
they prevent the GC to collect the memory associated with the userdata.]

Unless otherwise stated, *on error* all MoonUSB functions and methods raise a 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#lua_error[Lua error]. 
If needed, this behaviour can be overridden by wrapping function calls in the standard Lua 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#pdf-pcall[pcall](&nbsp;).

MoonUSB supports multiple concurrent libusb <<context, contexts>> (that is, sessions), but
it does not support multithreading.
